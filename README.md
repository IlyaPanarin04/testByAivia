In order to start the service you need to use the terminal to go to the folder "app" and make the command:

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Note

I commented out all the fragments that work with the database because when setting up the service I thought that a database would be needed, I left it because it allows you to expand the code at any time by adding queries that work with the database.
